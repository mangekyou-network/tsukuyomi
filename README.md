## Key Components

1. Shared Sequencer Rollup (SSR)
- Purpose: To observe shared state and ensure atomic settlement for arbitragers.
- Functionality: The SSR coordinates and synchronizes multiple transactions, ensuring that all operations are settled atomically. This is crucial for arbitragers who need reliable and consistent state observations to make informed decisions and execute trades effectively.

2. Hyperlane for Cross-Chain ZK Identity Audit
- Purpose: To perform zero-knowledge (ZK) identity audits across different blockchain networks.
- Functionality: Utilizing the Hyperlane protocol, this component enables cross-chain verification of user identities. Currently, it integrates with WorldID to verify and audit identities without revealing sensitive information, ensuring privacy and security.

3. Namespace Marketplace for cross-rollups using Astria execution APIs
- Purpose: To label and categorize all activities associated with a wallet by minting a soulbound NFT.
- Functionality: This marketplace allows users to mint soulbound NFTs that act as immutable records of their activities within the ecosystem. These NFTs provide a transparent and verifiable history of actions, enhancing trust and accountability.

## Features

- Atomic Settlement for Arbitragers: Ensures that arbitrage transactions are executed in a coordinated and reliable manner.
- Cross-Chain Identity Verification: Provides a secure and private method for identity verification across multiple blockchains.
- Activity Labeling with Soulbound NFTs: Offers a unique way to document and verify wallet activities through non-transferable NFTs.
